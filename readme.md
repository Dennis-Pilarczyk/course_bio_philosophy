This course is an introduction to the Philosophy of Biology, with application to
specific current problems.

It will focus on two major strands of thinking seeking answers to two fundamental and to some extend complementary questions: “How do we know?” [epistemology] and “What things really exist in the world?” [ontology]. These two themes have the most important impact on the practice of science, as they pertain to the nature of the scientific enterprise and how it works [epistemology and philosophy of science], as well as what scientists consider part of reality [=science related ontology: unicorns and phlogiston NO; atoms, electrons, YES; but what about species and genes? Do they have the same status as atoms?]. In each of these fields of philosophy we will outline the main positions and then discuss how they apply to past and current debates in biology, in particular, but not exclusively, evolutionary biology.


## Prerequisites

This course assumes that the student is familiar with core concepts in Biology, but does
not assume a background in philosophy.

The prerequisites for E&EB 321 are either a semester of biology or a semester of philosophy.

There are no prerequisites for E&EB 621.

## Course site

All materials for the course, including the syllabus, are available at the [course site](https://github.com/caseywdunn/course_bio_philosophy). Please submit suggestions and corrections for the class via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/caseywdunn/course_bio_philosophy/issues).

## Course format

Classes will consist of lectures, student led discussions, and project presentations.

## Assignments and Evaluation

### E&EB 321 (undergraduate seminar)

The course grade for E&EB 321 will be based on the following:

- 20% Responses to prompts
- 25% Midterm paper
- 40% Final paper
- 15% Class participation

There will be 2 prompts for questions throughout the course. The response is to be
400-500 words, excluding citations.

The midterm paper will be 6-8 pages, with the focus on describing multiple perspectives on a previously addressed problem in the Philosophy of Biology. The final paper will be 10-12 pages, and will provide a synthesis and novel approach to a different problem. An abstract will be submitted two weeks before the deadline for each.

The papers are to be double spaced 12 point font. They must be fully cited (references do not count toward the page limit).

### E&EB 621 (graduate seminar)

The assignments and evaluation for E&EB 621 will be as follows:

- 35% Class presentation
- 40% Responses to prompts
- 25% Class participation

The presentation will be 30 minutes (including questions) on a topic relevant to the graduate student's
research. It will be in the last class, or in the preceding two weeks depending on enrollment.

There will be 4 prompts for questions throughout the course. The response is to be
400-500 words, excluding citations.



## Readings

Readings will be drawn from the literature, and provided 5 days before each class. See the bibliography below
for example sources.

## Academic integrity

All students are expected to:

- Complete the assigned readings in full before class, and come to class prepared to discuss them in detail.
- Cite all sources in papers, including drafts, every time they use a source. This isn't just for attribution,
it is so that your reader understands the foundations of your assertions and knows where
to look for more information on a topic.
- Place quotation marks around any cited or cut-and-pasted materials, in addition to footnoting or otherwise marking the source.
- Mark each paraphrased source, as though it were quoted.
- List all sources consulted for the draft or paper in the closing materials, such as a bibliography or roster of sources consulted.
- Do not collaborate unless explicitly allowed.
- Do not submit another person's solution to a problem, including a solution found online.
- Do not submit or reuse material from the same paper in multiple courses unless both instructors provide written permission to do so.
